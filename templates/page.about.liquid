    <p>Quincy co-founders Christina Wallace and Alex Nelson met at Harvard Business School and quickly became friends after bonding over their love of all things fashion.</p>
    <p>After graduation, Christina moved to Washington DC and Alex to London, both returning to corporate offices and a wardrobe of professional wear. After having fashion freedom at school, they soon resented getting dressed in the morning, forced into boring, ill-fitting, and often over-priced pieces that lacked any semblance of personality.</p>
    <p>They soon realized no one was making clothes for them - real, up-and-coming, on-the-go professional women. They wondered- what if there were clothes that were boardroom-appropriate but still allowed them to feel as stylish and authentic at work as they did in their downtime? And, what if those clothes actually fit well and didn't break the bank?</p>
    <p>A quick survey of their friends showed many women wanted just the same thing. So Alex and Christina decided to move to New York and start a new kind of fashion company &mdash; a line that would make their friends feel like their usual confident, stylish selves, even when they were at work. They started manufacturing right here in NYC to ensure the highest quality production, and before they knew it they were quite literally selling the blazers right off their backs.</p>
